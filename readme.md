# dominode - node's evented API for HTML5
# dominode - node point browser
# dominode - node style streams for DOM nodes

node.js describes itself as a framework for dealing with "evented i/o" and traditionally runs on the server. clients, however, are just a i/o bound as servers (ajax requests, file uploads, indexeddb/websql, etc.) and can benefit from the nice APIs that node has developed to solve these problems in a server environment.

dominode uses a few key javascript libraries from node (Stream, Util, etc) and adds some new syntax for dealing with the DOM
